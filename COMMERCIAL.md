# 💼 Commercial Licensing

## Why Commons Clause?

PineUI is free to use for:
- ✅ Internal business applications
- ✅ Open source projects
- ✅ Educational purposes
- ✅ Non-commercial use
- ✅ Embedded in your products (as long as PineUI itself isn't being sold)

However, you **cannot** offer PineUI as a paid service where the primary value comes from PineUI's functionality.

## When Do You Need a Commercial License?

You need a commercial license if you plan to:

❌ Offer PineUI as a hosted SaaS platform
❌ Sell PineUI-based tooling or services
❌ Provide PineUI as a managed service to customers
❌ Build a commercial platform where PineUI is the core offering
